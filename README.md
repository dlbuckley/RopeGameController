RopeGameController
==================

This app is a partner app to the TOWClient, it controls the Tug Of War multiplayer game that was created as part of 
our entry for the NSSpain 2013 hack day. The code is very thrown together in places due to lack of time and has some 
horrible known bugs, but it's an interesting proof of concept none the less.
